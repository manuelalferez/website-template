## Folders

* `.data`: The `.data` file extension is given to the data files that have been created by and used for a variety of different software applications. These files can be used on the Linux, Unix and MAC operating systems. The majority of DATA files are saved in the binary file format.

* `App.js`: Here is application code. Only that you need to understand is that we get the information from `data.md` and convert it with `Markdown` component and then we submit converted in a page.  

* `App.css`: Put here your *CSS* code. Remember this to apply styles:
